# Breathwork Coach

Calming breathwork coach with a soothing expanding circle, live timer, and science-backed presets to guide your inhale/hold/exhale rhythm in real time.

## Quick start
1. Open `breathwork.html` in a modern browser (desktop or mobile). No install or account needed.
2. Press **Start** to begin. Follow the circle and on-screen cues for inhale, holds, and exhale.
3. Tap **Reset** any time to restart the session timer.

## Tune it to you
- **Presets**: Choose a rhythm like Box Breathing, 4-7-8, or Functional via the preset buttons.
- **Breaths per minute or seconds**: Adjust BPM, inhale/exhale length, and holds with the sliders.
- **Audio & cues**: Toggle breathing sounds, chimes, or voice guidance. Set an interval reminder (0 = off).

## Tips
- Aim for a quiet, comfortable posture; let your belly rise on inhale and soften on exhale.
- Lengthen the exhale for relaxation; lengthen the inhale for gentle energy.
- Functional Breathing (slow—6 breaths per minute) is a good default for calm focus.
